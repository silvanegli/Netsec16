Feedback Challenge Proposal - Group 06:

1. Challenge

The challenge is nice, the multiple steps required make it interesting. The way
the admin commands-posting works could be explained in a clearer way, but that
will be easier once you have the implementation. One suggestion (not sure if you
already planned to do this) to enhance the final part of the challenge: you cond
consider limiting the kind of bash command the admin is meant to issue, for
instance by having a bash command to change the color that just takes a
parameter containing the color value. This would then require a bash code
injection.
The challenge seems feasible to implement. Be careful not to over-engineer the
implementation: this is not a software engineering project, so you should spend
most of the time to make a nice challenge, which should work and be easy to test
for us.

2. Form

The write-up look good, but you should still improve it for the final version.
Clarify how the administrator commands work. In the final report you could maybe
add some screenshots to either the step-by-step instructions or the challenge
description (to add some flavor). Also, you should add the references from where
you learned about the vulnerabilities. Make sure that you include a section
about the setup of the challenge if anything more than just starting the VMs is
needed. Keep in mind that we don't want to spend time to figure out how to setup
and do your challenge.
